READ ME FOR DEMO 3 CONTAINED IN DEMO3 BRANCH (TEXT-BASED IN DEMO1 BRANCH)

Pong: 
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download the PongTextBased.zip file. It contains three different classes.
Run the class Game.java, which will allow you to choose between a ball and a paddle demo. The ball demo presents you with the option to see the ball movements, and prints out whenever the ball bounces off the walls/ceiling/floor. The paddle demo gives you the initial   position of the paddle, and allows you to change its position via input.
  
Crossy Road: 
  To compile the CR demo, download the Frogger zip file and run the CrossyRoadMainClass.java zip. Press the Q key for player 1 to move forward, press the R key for player 2 to move forward, press the U key for player 3 to move forward and press the P key for player 4 to move forard. If they collide with a rectangle, they will respawn at the start of the start of the running map. (For our final video we will have to implement more buses throughout the map, fix our score for players, make the map stop from running, stop the players when they win and also when they reach the end of the map)
  
Main Menu / Pacman: 
  To compile the Main Menu or Pacman, download and extract the Menu&Pacman.zip folder. 
  For the Main Menu, go to Menu&Pacman > src > pixelpartymenu and compile and run MenuMainClass.java
  For the Pacman, go to Menu&Pacman > src > pacman and compile and run PacmanMainClass.java
  
  Input Commands are Q: Player1, R: Player2, U: Player3, P: Player4
  Remember, for Pacman Q/R control player1, and U/P control player2!
  
  The Main Menu is missing key components, however the character selection, panel outlines and general structure of the menu is sufficient for implementation. Things like the information panel, pre-game/game data displays and game start,run,end functionality aren't implemented, but will be when all games meet the requirements for easy implementation connectability.
  
  Pacman is fully functionable and playable, with the scores from the players being written to a file, which will later be parsed into the main leaderboard when implemented.
