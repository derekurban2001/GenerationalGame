TextBased Demo 2

Pong: 
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download the PongTextBased.zip file. It contains three different classes.
  Run the class Game.java, which will allow you to choose between a ball and a paddle demo. The ball demo presents you with the option to see the ball movements, and prints out whenever the ball bounces off the walls/ceiling/floor. The paddle demo gives you the initial position of the paddle, and allows you to change its position via input.
  
Crossy Road: 
To compile the CR demo, download the Crossy-Road-GUI zip file contained in the Demo2 branch of Github. Run the class GUI.java, click the button below the player to move them forward, if they collide with a bus, they will respawn at the start of the map.
  
Pacman: 
To compile download the Pacman-Demo1.zip folder and run the PacmanMainClass.java in the src folder. This folder contains several other .java classes (AI, AnimationUpdater, GUI, ObjectMovementHandler, PacmanMainClass, Player). This program currently takes in user input, and returns the cooresponding x, y coordinate of the player, as well as the x, y coordinates of the ghost (AI) at all times. If the user collides the the ghost appropriate outprints are provided
