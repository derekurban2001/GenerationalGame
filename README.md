  To compile the CR demo, download 3 files (Player.java, Movement.java, Obstacles.java) contained in the CR branch of Github
  Run the class Movement.java which contains a method to move a single player forward and track their position via print statements
  (Press s and then enter to move the player forward, doing so will print out their current position, pressing any other key will not
