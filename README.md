READ ME FOR DEMO 3 CONTAINED IN DEMO3 BRANCH (TEXT-BASED IN DEMO1 BRANCH)

Pong: 
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download the PONGDemo3.zip file. Extract the file, import all classes from the src folder and run the PongMain class. Press the Up arrow key to change directions for the top paddle, press the left arrow key to change directions for the left paddle, press the down arrow key to change directions for the bottom paddle and press the right arrow key to change directions for the right paddle. As of now, the game runs so players are able to play with a negative score, however when all the games are merged, Pong will end as soon as any of the players get a score of 0. The java doc is also available in the doc folder. 
  
Crossy Road: 
  To compile the CR demo, download the Frogger zip file, extract it and run the CrossyRoadMainClass.java from the src folder. Press the Q key for player 1 to move forward, press the R key for player 2 to move forward, press the U key or player 3 to move forward and press the P key for player 4 to move forard. If they collide with a rectangle, they will respawn at the start of the start of the running map. (For our final video we will have to implement more buses throughout the map, fix our score for players, make the map stop from running, stop the players when they win and also when they reach the end of the mapp)
  
Main Menu / Pacman: 
  To compile the Main Menu or Pacman, download and extract the Menu&Pacman.zip folder. 
  For the Main Menu, go to Menu&Pacman > src > pixelpartymenu and compile and run MenuMainClass.java
  For the Pacman, go to Menu&Pacman > src > pacman and compile and run PacmanMainClass.java
  
  Input Commands are Q: Player1, R: Player2, U: Player3, P: Player4
  Remember, for Pacman Q/R control player1, and U/P control player2!
  
  The Main Menu is missing key components, however the character selection, panel outlines and general structure of the menu is sufficient for implementation. Things like the information panel, pre-game/game data displays and game start,run,end functionality aren't implemented, but will be when all games meet the requirements for easy implementation connectability.
  
  Pacman is fully functionable and playable, with the scores from the players being written to a file, which will later be parsed into the main leaderboard when implemented.
