TextBased Demo 1 

Pong: 
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download three files. The first one is the TextBasedBallFinal.zip which contains
  two different classes(Ball.java and Game.java) and the Paddle.java.
  Run the class Game.java, which will show the pixel movements of the ball.
  Run the Paddle.java, which will show the pixel movements of the paddle.
  
Crossy Road: To compile the CR demo, download 4 files (Player.java, Movement.java, Obstacles.java and Main.java) contained in the CR branch of Github. Run the class Main.java which calls the moveplayer forward method in the Movement class to move a single player forward and track their position via print statements (Press s and then enter to move the player forward, doing so will print out their current position, pressing any other key will not move the player. Press n to exit the loop and "end the game").

  
Pacman: 
To compile download the Pacman-Demo1.zip folder and run the PacmanMainClass.java in the src folder. This folder contains several other .java classes (AI, AnimationUpdater, GUI, ObjectMovementHandler, PacmanMainClass, Player). This program currently takes in user input, and returns the cooresponding x, y coordinate of the player, as well as the x, y coordinates of the ghost (AI) at all times. If the user collides the the ghost appropriate outprints are provided
