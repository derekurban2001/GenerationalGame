READ ME FOR DEMO 2 CONTAINED IN DEMO 2 BRANCH (TEXT-BASED DEMO 1 BELOW)

Pong: 
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download the PongTextBased.zip file. It contains three different classes.
  Run the class Game.java, which will allow you to choose between a ball and a paddle demo. The ball demo presents you with the option to see the ball movements, and prints out whenever the ball bounces off the walls/ceiling/floor. The paddle demo gives you the initial position of the paddle, and allows you to change its position via input.
  
Crossy Road: 
To compile the CR demo, download the Frogger(Demo 3) zip file and run the CrossyRoadMainClass.java zip. Press the Q key for player 1 to move forward, press the R key for player 2 to move forward, press the U key for player 3 to move forward and press the P key for player 4 to move forard. If they collide with a rectangle, they will respawn at the start of the start of the running map. (For our final video we will have to implement more buses throughout the map, fix our score for players, make the map stop from running, stop the players when they win and also when they reach the end of the map)
  
Pacman: 
To compile download the Pacman-Demo1.zip folder and run the PacmanMainClass.java in the src folder. This version of the code is only runnable with a Phidgets VINT Hub connection. So plug in a vint hub connection with appropriate button and LED ports connected.
