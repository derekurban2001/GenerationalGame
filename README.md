TextBased Demo 1 

Pong
  To compile the Pong demo, you will need to download two files. The first one is the TextBasedBallFinal.zip which contains
  two different classes(Ball.java and Game.java).
  Run the class Game.java, which will show the pixel movements of the ball.

Crossy Road
  To compile the CR demo, download 3 files (Player.java, Movement.java, Obstacles.java) contained in the CR branch of Github
  Run the class Movement.java which contains a method to move a single player forward and track their position via print statements
  (Press s and then enter to move the player forward, doing so will print out their current position, pressing any other key will not
  move the player).
