# PixelParty
Project Description:

  The Pixel Party game consists of three different minigames. These minigames are: PacMan, Frogger and Pong. The game is played with four players. The players will receive points after each minigame, which will be tracked using a leaderboard. Frogger and Pong are free-for-all games, meanwhile the players will be in teams of two for PacMan. 

  Upon running the game, the user is presented with a screen with the options to play or exit. After clicking play, the user is presented with the "Welcome to Pixel Party!" screen, which contains the basic instructions for the game, including the corresponding buttons for each of the players. Each player will only need to use one button to play any of the games. The buttons used for this game are: Q,R,U,P for players 1,2,3,4 respectively. After clicking the Next button, the players are presented with the screen where the choose the colour for their character. The colour that they choose will be their corresponding colour in each of the minigames, and players have the option to change their colour at any point by going back to the colour-choosing screen. The players won't be able to click the Next button until each of the players have chosen a colour. After clicking Next, the players are presented with the screen which has the leaderboard and the order of the minigames (which is randomly chosen). They also have the ability to press the "How To Play" button which will provide them with instructions on how to play the upcoming minigame in the order. To play the minigame, each of the players must press their own button to confirm that they are ready to start, and once all players are ready, they can click the Next button, which will start the minigame.
  
  After each of the minigames, each player will be rewarded points based on their performance, and will be brought back to the screen with the leaderboard and the minigame order. The "How-To-Play" button will be updated for the upcoming minigame, and the players must once again confirm that they are ready by pressing their corresponding button. After each of the minigames is played, the players are given the choice to "Play Again", and if they choose to do so, the minigames will then be placed in a random order again. Note that the players will keep the points from their past games on the leaderboard, and the points from the following games will be added onto their current points. At any point, players can keep pressing the back button until they return to the screen with the "Exit" button if they choose to exit, or they can simply press the red "X" at the top right.
